            <p>I'm a web developer from a small northern town in the UK.</p>

            <p>I'd describe my self as a front end focused, full stack developer. Meaning I'm most comfortable with front end technologies and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, and React. I'm also comfortable with coding in Python and Django, as well as node.js</p>

            <p>To keep up to date with my work, you can check out <a href="http://codepen.io/daniellenall">CodePen</a> or <a href="http://github.com/daniellenall">GitHub</a>. I also ocassionally post on <a href="http://twitter.com/daniellernall">Twitter</a>. I'm trying to constantly learn and develop my skills further</p>

            <p>Improving this portfolio is on my list of todos, but for now I'd be happy to provide links to my recent work on request.</p>

            <p>I'm currently available for work, if you have something you'd like to discuss, <a href="mailto:hi@daniellenall.com">let's chat</a>.</p>
